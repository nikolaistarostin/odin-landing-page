# Affie's Landing Page
Hellow! My name is Nikolai Starostin. This is a **landing page** for my dog, Affie!
It is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) course. 

You can check out the website here: [Preview](https://nikolaistarostin.github.io/odin-landing-page/). It is pretty :)

This project was very interesting to build. I've learned basics of **flexbox** and now I know more about placing elements on web pages.


Thank you a lot for spending time on my website, hope you have enjoyed it. If you have any suggestions, email me at **nikolstarostin@gmail.com**.
